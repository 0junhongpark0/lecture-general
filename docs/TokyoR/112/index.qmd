::: notes
So, We developed real-time web application that researchers can use easily. First, We have released openstat dot A.I., a free web site, containing analyzes commonly used in medical research. Researchers do not need to install it on their PCs, but can access it from any device including PC, mobile and tablet. Researchers can directly upload their data, and analyze it with a click rather than coding, and download the report right away. Customized web application for specific researches are provided with paid service.

## R package for medical research

CRAN(計15万回ダウンロード)

- [jskm](https://github.com/jinseob2kim/jskm): 生存分析 kaplan-meier plot
- [jstable](https://github.com/jinseob2kim/jskm): 回帰分析 テーブル作り
- [jsmodule](https://github.com/jinseob2kim/jskm): Shiny module & ローカルコンピュータでopenstat.aiを実行

::: notes
We have modulized more than 90% of analytical methods of medical researches. And all analytical modules are released as open source softwares. Anyone can reuse our codes. Figures below are open source softwares we developed with R, a programing language in field of data science

::: notes
We were selected for open source SW start-up and open source software R&D hosted by Ministry of Science and ICT, based on our contribution to open source and community. The topic of R and D is to develop Cloud based open-source statistical software for general public, not doctors. As you see the figure below, we are developing it under the project name of "statgarten".

## Achievements

-   Support \>300 SCI papers.
-   Venture business certificate
-   100,000 Download: open-source package

::: notes
Now, I will introduce other achievement. Since establishing the company, we have supported data analysis more than three hundred SCI papers including the Lancet, the world's most prestigious journal, and our open source statistical package recorded more than one hundred thousand downloads. Based on this, we get venture business certificate and various start-up support programs.

## Plan

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Now: medical research**

-   No.1 data analysis
-   Global service
-   Open-source contribution
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Future: new drug**

-   Clinical trial data analysis
-   With global pharma, CRO, big tech
-   DTx/DCT specific service
:::
:::

::: notes
I will tell you about our future plan. Our current goal is to become the No. 1 data analysis company in the field of medical research. I think we are already No. 1.

Based on a strong network with Korean researchers, we are actively supporting global collaborative research. In addition, We will continuously contribute to the open source ecosystem and related communities.

We currently support analytics for medical research., but we plan to support analysis for clinical trials in the future. We have signed our first contract with domestic pharma company recently. Especially, We will provide service specialized especially for Digital Therapeutics(DTx) and decentralized clinical trial(DCT).

::: notes
Zarathu thinks 'Save the World' and 'Produce rising star' as our core value. We start by saving the world by helping medical researchers to make new medical knowledge, and finally we support our next generations to save the universe. The most important thing for us is to produce our data scientists as global stars. We will create new job called 'research support specialist' and make this job more popular than doctor and lawyer.

I want to suggest one thing to everyone here. Zarathu can help your country to make a better use of medical data. We can help to standardize the data for global collaborative research, and to use Openstat.ai service specific to your country. We will also support analytical service. We will not end just providing service, but we will produce young data scientists in your country . We will constantly do education and internship program and support to recruit them in Korea.
