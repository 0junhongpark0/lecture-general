Hello, Thank you for being here.  I'm Jinseob Kim, CEO of Zarathu Company. I’m going to talk about my business and what we can do together. 

Let’s start by introducing my service. Zarathu provide analytic services for medical research. Firstly, We develop web-based statistical software that doctors can easily analyze without install. Korea has high-quality public health big data at the national level, so doctors do many studies with this data. For example, National Health Insurance Service(NHIS) and Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service(HIRA) support big data research using their data.

We also provide statistical consulting and education for doctors, researchers and students.

## No service for medical research

-  Doctors don't have time to analyze their data
-  Statistical software is not specialized in medical research


**Doctors need fast, easy-to-use and medical-specific service**
