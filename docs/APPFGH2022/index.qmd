Hello, Thank you for being here.  I'm Jinseob Kim, CEO of Zarathu Company. I’m going to talk about my business and what we can do together.
Let’s start by introducing my service. Zarathu provides analytic services for medical research. Firstly, We develop web-based statistical software that doctors can easily use without installing it. Second, we help medical researchers analyze national data. Korea has high-quality healthcare big data at the national level, so doctors do many studies with this data. For example, National Health Insurance Service(NHIS) and Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service(HIRA) support big data research using their data.
We also provide statistical consulting and education for doctors, researchers and students.

## Medical data is important

There are tears of patients and doctors in **Medical data**

-   A record of desperate struggle of patients and doctors
-   Data $\rightarrow$ knowledge & technology 
-   Better data analysis saves lives


::: {.notes}
But, do you think it is really necessary? Let’s talk about medical data first. Medical data is very important. This is a record of desperate struggle of patients and doctors. There are a lot of tears in it. We should make knowledge and technology that can save the world with this data. Better data analysis saves lives.

## Medical research surge

With Covid19 

-  Medical research has doubled.

-  Clinical trials for new drugs are also on the rise

-  Digital Therapeutics(DTx), decentralized clinical trial(DCT) 

::: {.notes}
Now, many people think that medical data and research are important. After Covid-19, the demands for analyzing medical data has been rapidly increased. and the number of medical articles increased double. Not just researching, but clinical trials to develop new drugs are also increasing. As IT technology develops, not only edible drugs but also mobile apps are recognized as digital therapeutics, DTx, and clinical trials do not require patients to visit a hospital. This is called decentralized clinical trial, DCT.

## No service for medical research

-  Doctors don't have time to analyze their data
-  Statistical software is not specialized in medical research


**Doctors need fast, easy-to-use and medical-specific service**

::: {.notes}
Although the demand for medical data analysis is increasing, there was no service that researchers can quickly and easily use. 
In case of existing statistical software, we should pay a fee, install it and code ourselves. And there is a lack of analysis modules specialized in the medical field.  Furthermore, it is hard to find companies that have medical expertise. 
Doctors want services that is easy and quick to use and specialized for medical field.

::: {.notes}
So, We developed real-time web application that researchers can use easily. 
First, We have released openstat dot A.I., a free web site, containing analyzes commonly used in medical research. Researchers do not need to install it on their PCs, but can access it from any device including PC, mobile and tablet. Researchers can directly upload their data, and analyze it with a click rather than coding, and download the report right away. Customized web application for specific researches are provided with paid service.

## 2. Open-source package

-  Analysis module: cover 90% of medical research 
-  Open-source: you can see all our source code

::: {.notes}
We have modulized more than 90% of analytical methods of medical researches. And all analytical modules are released as open source softwares. Anyone can reuse our codes. Figures below are open source softwares we developed with R, a programing language in field of data science

## Open-source R&D

**Cloud based open-source statistical software development**

-  Ministry of Science and ICT($800,000)
-  **Fast, Easy-to-use, and for all people**

::: {.notes}
We were selected for open source SW start-up and open source software R&D hosted by Ministry of Science and ICT, based on our contribution to open source and community. 
The topic of R and D is to develop Cloud based open-source statistical software for general public, not doctors. As you see the figure below, we are developing it under the project name of “statgarten”.

## Achievements

-  Support >300 SCI papers.
-  Venture business certificate
-  100,000 Download: open-source package

Zarathu thinks ‘Save the World’ and ‘Produce rising star’ as our core value. 
We start by saving the world by helping medical researchers to make new medical knowledge, and finally we support our next generations to save the universe. 
The most important thing for us is to produce our data scientists as global stars. We will create new job called ‘research support specialist’ and make this job  more popular than doctor and lawyer.
